# Conversational Robotics & AI

Conversational robotics combines natural language processing, dialogue management, and robotic control to create systems that can communicate naturally with humans. This chapter explores the architecture and implementation of conversational interfaces for robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Design dialogue systems for robotic applications
- Integrate large language models with robotic systems
- Implement context awareness for conversational robots
- Create voice interfaces for natural interaction
- Develop emotional intelligence capabilities for robots
- Address privacy and security concerns in conversational systems

## Chapter Overview

This chapter covers the essential aspects of conversational robotics, from basic dialogue management to advanced natural language understanding. We'll explore how to create robots that can engage in natural, context-aware conversations while performing physical tasks.
