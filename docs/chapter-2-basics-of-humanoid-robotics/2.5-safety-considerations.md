# 2.5 Safety Considerations

Safety is paramount in humanoid robotics, particularly as these systems are designed to operate in human environments and interact directly with people. Unlike industrial robots typically separated from humans by safety barriers, humanoid robots must ensure safe operation while sharing spaces with humans, making safety considerations an integral part of design, control, and operation. This section explores the multifaceted approach required to ensure safe humanoid robot operation in various contexts.

## Core Definition

Safety considerations in humanoid robotics encompass all measures, designs, and protocols implemented to prevent harm to humans, property, and the robot itself during normal operation and in failure scenarios. This includes mechanical design for safe interaction, control algorithms that prevent dangerous behaviors, sensing systems that detect potential hazards, and operational protocols that ensure safe deployment. Safety must be considered at every level, from component selection to system-wide behavior.
