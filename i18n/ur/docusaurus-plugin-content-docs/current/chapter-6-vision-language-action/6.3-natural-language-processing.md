# 6.3 Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks enables robots to understand and generate human language, facilitating natural and intuitive interaction between humans and robotic systems. This capability is crucial for creating robots that can receive verbal instructions, engage in conversations, and express their understanding and intentions in human-understandable terms. In VLA systems, NLP serves as the bridge between human communication and robotic action, enabling seamless integration of linguistic input with visual perception and physical action.

## Core Definition

Natural Language Processing in Vision-Language-Action frameworks refers to the computational methods and algorithms that enable robots to understand, interpret, and generate human language in the context of visual perception and physical action. NLP in VLA systems goes beyond traditional language understanding to include the grounding of linguistic concepts in visual reality and the generation of language that describes visual scenes and planned actions. This integration allows robots to process natural language commands, answer questions about visual scenes, and communicate their understanding and intentions to human users.
