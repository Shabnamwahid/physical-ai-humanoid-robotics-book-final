# 1.3 Key Components of Physical AI Systems

Physical AI systems are complex integrated entities that combine multiple technologies to achieve intelligent behavior in physical environments. Understanding these components and how they interact is fundamental to designing effective Physical AI systems.

## System Architecture Overview

Physical AI systems typically follow a perception-action cycle architecture:
