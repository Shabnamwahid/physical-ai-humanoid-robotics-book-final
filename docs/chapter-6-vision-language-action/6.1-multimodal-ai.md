# 6.1 Multimodal AI Fundamentals

Multimodal AI represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving beyond single-modal systems to embrace the integration of multiple sensory inputs and output modalities. In the context of humanoid robotics, multimodal AI systems combine visual perception, natural language processing, and physical action to create more human-like and intuitive robotic systems capable of complex interaction and decision-making in real-world environments.

## Core Definition

Multimodal AI in humanoid robotics refers to artificial intelligence systems that process and integrate information from multiple modalities—including visual, auditory, linguistic, and proprioceptive inputs—to generate coherent understanding and appropriate responses. These systems transcend traditional unimodal approaches by learning joint representations that capture correlations and dependencies across different sensory channels, enabling more robust and human-like behavior in robotic applications.
