# 2.2 Biomechanics and Biomimicry

Biomechanics is the study of the structure, function, and motion of the mechanical aspects of biological systems. In humanoid robotics, biomechanics serves as the foundation for designing robots that move and function like humans. By understanding how biological systems solve mechanical problems, engineers can create more efficient, stable, and human-like robotic systems.

## Core Definition

Biomechanics in humanoid robotics refers to the application of biological movement principles to the design and control of human-like robots. This field combines elements of biology, mechanics, and robotics to understand how biological systems achieve movement, stability, and efficiency, then applies these principles to robotic systems. Biomimicry specifically focuses on emulating biological solutions to engineering challenges in humanoid robot design.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Human Biomechanics
Understanding human movement patterns is essential for creating effective humanoid robots:

- **Kinematic chains**: How joints and segments connect to create movement
- **Musculoskeletal systems**: The interaction between muscles, bones, and joints
- **Energy efficiency**: How humans optimize movement to minimize energy consumption
- **Stability mechanisms**: How humans maintain balance during various activities

### Biological Movement Principles
Key principles that guide biomimetic design in humanoid robotics:

- **Redundancy**: Multiple pathways to achieve the same movement goal
- **Compliance**: Flexible responses to environmental perturbations
- **Adaptability**: Real-time adjustment to changing conditions
- **Coordination**: Synchronized movement of multiple body parts

## Skeletal System Analogies
