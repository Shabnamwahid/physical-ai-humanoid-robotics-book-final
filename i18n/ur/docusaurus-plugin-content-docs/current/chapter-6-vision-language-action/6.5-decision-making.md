# 6.5 Decision Making and Control

Decision making and control form the cognitive core of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, enabling robots to process multimodal inputs and generate appropriate responses in real-time. These systems integrate information from visual perception, language understanding, and environmental context to make intelligent decisions that guide robot behavior. Effective decision-making and control systems must balance computational efficiency with robustness, handle uncertainty, and maintain safety while operating in dynamic environments.

## Core Definition

This encompasses both high-level decision making that selects goals and strategies, and low-level control that generates precise motor commands. The system must process uncertain, multimodal information in real-time while ensuring safe and effective robot operation across diverse scenarios.
