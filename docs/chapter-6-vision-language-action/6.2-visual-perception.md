# 6.2 Visual Perception Systems

Visual perception systems form the cornerstone of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, enabling robots to understand and interpret their visual environment. These systems process visual information from cameras and other optical sensors to extract meaningful representations that can be used for decision-making, language grounding, and action execution. In humanoid robotics, visual perception systems must be robust, real-time capable, and capable of extracting both low-level features and high-level semantic understanding.

## Core Definition

Visual perception systems in Vision-Language-Action frameworks are computational systems that process visual information from optical sensors to extract meaningful representations of the environment. These systems transform raw pixel data into structured information that can be used for object recognition, scene understanding, spatial reasoning, and interaction with other modalities such as language and action. In VLA systems, visual perception serves as the primary input modality that grounds linguistic concepts in visual reality and provides the environmental context for action planning.
