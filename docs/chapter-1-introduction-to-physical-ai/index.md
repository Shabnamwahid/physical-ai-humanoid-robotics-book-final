# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the fascinating world of Physical AI - the convergence of artificial intelligence with the physical world through robotic systems. This chapter introduces the core concepts that form the foundation of embodied intelligence.

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI systems that operate purely in digital spaces to intelligent agents that interact with and learn from the physical environment. This field encompasses robotics, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and control theory, all unified by the goal of creating intelligent physical systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI approaches
- Understand the historical context and evolution of embodied intelligence
- Identify the key components required for Physical AI systems
- Recognize various applications and use cases of Physical AI
- Analyze the current challenges and future opportunities in the field

## Chapter Overview

This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to Physical AI, covering both theoretical foundations and practical considerations. We'll explore how intelligent systems can perceive, reason about, and act within physical environments, setting the stage for the more technical content in subsequent chapters.
