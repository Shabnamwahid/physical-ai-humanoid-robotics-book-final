# ROS 2 Fundamentals

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) provides the middleware and tools necessary for developing complex robotic applications. This chapter introduces the core concepts, architecture, and practical applications of ROS 2 in modern robotics development.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the architecture and design principles of ROS 2
- Install and configure ROS 2 development environments
- Create and manage nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Implement parameter management for runtime configuration
- Design lifecycle management systems for robust operation
- Apply testing and debugging techniques for ROS 2 applications

## Chapter Overview

This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to ROS 2, covering both theoretical concepts and practical implementation. We'll explore the distributed nature of ROS 2, its communication patterns, and best practices for developing robust robotic applications.
