You should be able to, from that task\ncard, assign one of the valid users. When you first launch Taskify, it\'s going to give you a list of the five users to pick\nfrom. There will be no password required. When you click on a user, you go into the main view, which displays the list of\nprojects. When you click on a project, you open the Kanban board for that project.
