# Generate Content for Chapter 8: Capstone Project

## Objective

Analyze the folder docs/chapter-8-capstone-project.
Generate complete textual content for each section (8.1 to 8.6) using Chapter 1 as the structural and pedagogical template.

Keep the headings, subheadings, and index intact.
Use educational, clear, and concise language suitable for a technical textbook on humanoid robotics.
Include examples, textual descriptions of diagrams, and key points for each topic.
After generating content, update history/prompts automatically without changing any existing files outside the chapter-8 folder.
Keep track of which sections were previously empty and now filled.
Do not overwrite other chapters or appendices.
